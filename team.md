HAGI is a collective of artists, makers and writers. When we came together to discuss fostering empathy and connection in our work together, we realized that there is a certain power in anonymity.

We embrace HAGI as a collective identity by which our efforts in this pursuit might be known.  

You might consider us pilgrims, committed to search for new ways of contributing to an idea bigger than any of us. Thank you for honoring our journey and we hope HAGI adds to yours.
