HAGI is a collective of artists, makers and writers. When we came together to discuss the power of empathy and connection we realized that there is a certain power in anonymity.

We embrace instead a collective identity by which our efforts in this pursuit might be known.  

You can consider us pilgrims, committed to search for new ways of contributing to an idea bigger than any of us. Thank you for honouring our journey and we hope HAGI adds to yours.
